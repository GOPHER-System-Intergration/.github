# GOPHER System Integration GitHub Organization

The GOPHER System Integration focuses on the development and integration of a tele-nursing robotic system. The repositories within this organization contain software packages, firmware, and tools for controlling, simulating, and interacting with robotic system, including the Kinova Gen3 robotic arms, Fetch Freight100 mobile base, motorized chest and other hardware components.

## Repositories

- **kinova_pid:** A modified version of Andrew J Zelenak's ROS PID package tailored for Kinova Gen3 joints control.

- **relaxed_ik_ros1:** Based on the RelaxedIK repository, this repository includes additional config files to use relaxedIK with the Kinova Gen3 Robotic Arm.

- **kinova_positional_control:** A repository focused on positional control for the Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.

- **haptic-AR-Vive:** Work published in ICRA 2022 that deals with haptic feedback and AR using the HTC Vive system. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9811669

- **gopher_ros_clearcore:** Software for bridging ROS and ClearCore firmware, facilitating integration and communication over a serial protocol.

- **gopher_clearcore_firmware:** Contains ClearCore I/O Controller firmware for GOPHER project motorized chest component.

- **stand_chest_description:** The Gazebo simulation of the chest used in the GOPHER project.

- **unity_ros:** A repository focused on ROS integration with Unity for developing robotic simulations and interactive environments.

- **ROS-Unity-Camera-Streaming:** Camera streaming code for ROS to Unity VR projects, enabling real-time visualization of robotic systems.

- **gopher-keyboard-control:** Baseline keyboard velocity control for the GOPHER project.

- **Unity-Control-Environment:** A repository for developing and managing Unity-based control environments for GOPHER project components.
